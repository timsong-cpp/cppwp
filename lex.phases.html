<span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='mapping_physical_source_file_characters_to_basic_source_character_set'></a></span>implementation-defined manner,
to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line
indicators) if necessary.
The set of physical source file characters accepted is <span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='physical_source_file_characters'></a></span>implementation-defined.
Any
source file character not in the basic source character
set (<a href='lex.charset'>[lex.charset]</a>) is replaced by the
<span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='universal_character_name'></a></span><i ><a href='lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name'>universal-character-name</a></i> that
designates that character. An implementation may use any internal
encoding, so long as an actual extended character encountered in the
source file, and the same extended character expressed in the source
file as a <i ><a href='lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name'>universal-character-name</a></i> (e.g., using the <span class='texttt'>\uXXXX</span> notation), are handled equivalently
except where this replacement is reverted (<a href='lex.pptoken'>[lex.pptoken]</a>) in a raw string literal.</p><p ><span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='line_splicing'></a></span></p></li><li ><p >Each instance of a backslash character (\)
immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing
physical source lines to form logical source lines. Only the last
backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
of such a splice.
Except for splices reverted in a raw string literal, if a splice results in
a character sequence that matches the
syntax of a <i ><a href='lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name'>universal-character-name</a></i>, the behavior is
undefined. A source file that is not empty and that does not end in a new-line
character, or that ends in a new-line character immediately preceded by a
backslash character before any such splicing takes place,
shall be processed as if an additional new-line character were appended
to the file.</p></li><li ><p >The source file is decomposed into preprocessing
tokens (<a href='lex.pptoken'>[lex.pptoken]</a>) and sequences of white-space characters
(including comments). A source file shall not end in a partial
preprocessing token or in a partial comment.<a class='footnotenum' href='#footnote-13'>13</a>
Each comment is replaced by one space character. New-line characters are
retained. Whether each nonempty sequence of white-space characters other
than new-line is retained or replaced by one space character is
unspecified. The process of dividing a source file's
characters into preprocessing tokens is context-dependent.
[&nbsp;<i>Example:</i><span class='space'></span>
see the handling of <span class='texttt'>&lt;</span> within a <span class='texttt'>#include</span> preprocessing
directive.

expanded, and <span class='texttt'>_Pragma</span> unary operator expressions are executed.
If a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
<i ><a href='lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name'>universal-character-name</a></i> is produced by token
concatenation (<a href='cpp.concat'>[cpp.concat]</a>), the behavior is undefined. A
<span class='texttt'>#include</span> preprocessing directive causes the named header or
source file to be processed from phase 1 through phase 4, recursively.
All preprocessing directives are then deleted.</p></li><li ><p >Each source character set member in a character literal or a string
literal, as well as each escape sequence and <i ><a href='lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name'>universal-character-name</a></i> in a
character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding
member of the execution character set (<a href='lex.ccon'>[lex.ccon]</a>, <a href='lex.string'>[lex.string]</a>); if
there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an <span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='converting_characters_from_source_character_set_to_execution_character_set'></a></span>implementation-defined member other

result in one token being replaced by a sequence of other
tokens (<a href='temp.names'>[temp.names]</a>).<i>&nbsp;—&nbsp;end note</i>&nbsp;] [&nbsp;<i>Note:</i><span class='space'></span> Source files, translation

as follows: [&nbsp;<i>Note:</i><span class='space'></span> Some or all of these may be supplied from a

produce a list of required instantiations. [&nbsp;<i>Note:</i><span class='space'></span> This may include
instantiations which have been explicitly
requested (<a href='temp.explicit'>[temp.explicit]</a>). <i>&nbsp;—&nbsp;end note</i>&nbsp;] The definitions of the
required templates are located. It is <span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='whether_source_of_translation_units_must_be_available_to_locate_template_definitions'></a></span>implementation-defined whether the
source of the translation units containing these definitions is required
to be available. [&nbsp;<i>Note:</i><span class='space'></span> An implementation could encode sufficient
information into the translated translation unit so as to ensure the
source is not required here. <i>&nbsp;—&nbsp;end note</i>&nbsp;] All the required instantiations
are performed to produce
<a class='hidden_link' href='#def:instantiation_units' id='def:instantiation_units'><i>instantiation units</i></a>. [&nbsp;<i>Note:</i><span class='space'></span> These are similar
to translated translation units, but contain no references to
uninstantiated templates and no template definitions. <i>&nbsp;—&nbsp;end note</i>&nbsp;] The

components are linked to satisfy external references to
